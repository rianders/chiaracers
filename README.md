What is a Chia Racer

Concept:

Fair Use Building and Research labs created an open soruce RC Car self driving platform the intended use is to have a system that can
be used on extremely low cost that can be used in self driving car and machine learning education  from Middle school
to Adult Prosfesional. Including college level challenges.

The technology has been used at Rutgers University witht he Cetner for Math scheice and Comptuer Education to teach middle school, highschool, and college studentsabout self driving cars and machine learning.
